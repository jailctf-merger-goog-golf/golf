# basically we create a new grid and for each pixel on the new grid we copy over that pixel
# from the old grid

# BUT, we change it to the number 8 if it is not touching the wall, it is not air/0, and
# the topleft pixel to it and the bottomright pixel to it are the same color which are
# both not zero
